# Ravenous - Restaurant Search App

## Purpose

Ravenous is a web application that allows users to search for restaurants based on search terms, location, and sorting criteria. It leverages the Yelp Fusion API to retrieve real-time restaurant data. This project is an example of a restaurant search app built using React and demonstrates the use of API integration, state management, and responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Yelp Fusion API: Provides access to Yelp's vast database of restaurant information.
- Bootstrap: Used for styling and layout.
- CORS Anywhere: A CORS proxy server to bypass cross-origin restrictions when making API requests.

## Features

- Search for restaurants by entering a search term and location.
- Sort search results by "Best Match," "Highest Rated," "Most Reviewed," or "Distance."
- View restaurant details including name, address, category, rating, review count, and distance.
- Click on restaurant names to visit their websites.
- Click on restaurant addresses to open them in Google Maps.
- Responsive design for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Future Work

- Implement user authentication to save favorite restaurants.
- Add a review and rating feature for logged-in users.
- Improve the UI/UX design for a more polished look.
- Implement pagination for handling large result sets.
- Provide filtering options based on additional criteria (e.g., price range).
- Optimize API requests for performance and caching.
