# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Ravenous - Restaurant Search App

## Purpose

Ravenous is a web application that allows users to search for restaurants based on search terms, location, and sorting criteria. It leverages the Yelp Fusion API to retrieve real-time restaurant data. This project is an example of a restaurant search app built using React and demonstrates the use of API integration, state management, and responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Yelp Fusion API: Provides access to Yelp's vast database of restaurant information.
- Bootstrap: Used for styling and layout.
- CORS Anywhere: A CORS proxy server to bypass cross-origin restrictions when making API requests.

## Features

- Search for restaurants by entering a search term and location.
- Sort search results by "Best Match," "Highest Rated," "Most Reviewed," or "Distance."
- View restaurant details including name, address, category, rating, review count, and distance.
- Click on restaurant names to visit their websites.
- Click on restaurant addresses to open them in Google Maps.
- Responsive design for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Future Work

- Implement user authentication to save favorite restaurants.
- Add a review and rating feature for logged-in users.
- Improve the UI/UX design for a more polished look.
- Implement pagination for handling large result sets.
- Provide filtering options based on additional criteria (e.g., price range).
- Optimize API requests for performance and caching.
